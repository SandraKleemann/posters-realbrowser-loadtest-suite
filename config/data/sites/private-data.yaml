# This is all the private data that should not not leak into the standard repo
# We set .gitignore for that aka private-data.yaml is ignored, but this template
# is commited BUT not included into the project loading of data.

# Always copy this template locally for standard development into private-data.yaml
# and set the data that shoud not leak. You might have to extend this definition
# to site. Really depends on the setup.

# When you work on a real customer project, you can remove the .gitignore on 
# private-data.yaml and commit it, BUT NEVER FOR THE TEMPLATE.
