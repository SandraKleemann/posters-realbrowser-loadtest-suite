# Payment
#
# Payment Limitations
#
# A Usual Case is, that the payment provider blocks an specific range of order totals to be fulfilled.
# Important: Keep in mind, that this value only takes the product price into account so, taxes and shipping costs
# will raise the totals. So use a value below the real order limit to ensure additional costs will be handled correctly.
#
# Because the range might also be a rather permitted range or both ranges
# are different, you can specify permitted and blocked. Permitted will be checked first
# and blocked next.
# Make sure that both are disjunct or min permitted < min blocked, otherwise
# we are totally screwed.
